##### Getting Started with BlueJ
###### Reading: Module Learning Outcomes
**Fundamental Java Syntax and Semantics Module**
In this module, you will learn to write and run your first Java programs, including one program that prints “Hello!” in various countries’ languages and another where you will analyze the perimeters and other information of shapes. To accomplish these tasks, you will learn the basics of Java syntax and how to design stepwise solutions with programs.

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Download and run BlueJ, the Java programming environment for this course;
- Access the documentation for the Java libraries specially designed for this course;
- Edit, compile, and run a Java program;
- Construct methods, variables, if else statements, and for each loops in Java; and
- Use Iterables (like DirectoryResource) to run a program that iterates over multiples lines in a document or webpage or multiple files in a directory.



###### Video 1. Why Use Java?

Hi, in this lesson we're gonna introduce you to Java programming. In the BlueJ environment we use in this course to design, develop, test and run Java programs. Java is a popular and widely used language. It is the **foundation for the Android operating system** that powers more smart phones than any other system in the world. Java is an extremely useful and quite powerful language, with extensive support on almost every kind of computer. Java is also accessible to beginners, which is why we're using it in our courses. At the end of this lesson, you'll have experience with **BlueJ**, the development environment we use for programming with Java. You'll be able to use BlueJ to compile and run a java program. You'll know the basic design, edit, compile, and the execute cycle. That's part of programming with hundreds of different languages. And you'll see first hand how simple and powerful Java is, in accessing information that will print hello world in many languages. This is our take on a traditional first program. We'll explain that more as you begin your exploration of Java programming. So hola, mundo, konichiwa, nihao and hello world. Let's get started.
